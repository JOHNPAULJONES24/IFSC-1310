Dragon Project Revision and Reflection
In this assignment I ask that you collect feedback from a peer, family member, or a friend on your first attempt at the Dragon or Segway project. Using that feedback, I'd like you to attempt to address any issues or problems pointed out by your potential users. You should provide a link to the revised project (duplicate the directory in aws and then add a link to the revised project (see above). You should also provide several paragraphs reflecting on the learning experience working on this project and your experience during the semester. What were the things you did well? What would you do differently if you had to startover? Also report on the feedback you received and what you did to address those issues or why you chose not to make the recommended changes.

Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement

     When speaking to my family and friends, I found them very halpful in making things moer user "user friendly".
I found that the older ones, and the ones with sight problems wanted the fonts to be at least 12 inches. Also contrast is a very importaint. Furthermore, having good contrast also is very importaint. These simple, yet vital things, make the difference in the true understanding of the material.

    I have found that I have learned to try to make things more simplified. This reflects well for the user experience, and adds to the over all, coheasion, for the user. This also enhances the full comprehention, between the user, and the programer. It is vital over all.
